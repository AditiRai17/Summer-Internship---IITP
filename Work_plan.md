# Three-Week Project Plan for Developing **Defendify**

## Week 1: Initial Setup, Requirements, and Basic Framework

### Goals:
- Set up the development environment.
- Define project requirements.
- Develop the basic framework.
- Integrate HoneyPot

### Day 1-2: Environment Setup
- **Install necessary tools and dependencies:**
  - Git, build-essential, gcc, cmake, etc.
  - Elastic Stack components (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Filebeat).
- **Set up your development environment:**
  - Configure your IDE/editor with project-specific settings.
  - Set up a version control system (Git).

### Day 3-4: Define Project Requirements
- **Define project scope and requirements:**
  - Document features and functionalities needed.
  - Define architecture and components (manager, agents, data collectors).
- **Create initial project documentation:**
  - README.md with project overview and goals.
  - LICENSE file if applicable.

### Day 5-7: Develop Basic Framework
- **Set up the project structure:**
  - Create directories for different components (e.g., manager, agent, common).
  - Initialize basic files for each component (e.g., main.c, config.c, Makefile).
- **Develop basic communication framework:**
  - Implement basic server-client communication using sockets.
  - Create a simple configuration file parser.

## Week 2: Core Functionality Development

### Goals:
- Develop core functionalities (data collection, log processing, alerting).
- Implement basic security and monitoring features.

### Day 1-2: Data Collection
- **Develop data collection module:**
  - Implement log collectors to gather data from various sources (e.g., syslogs, application logs).
  - Create interfaces for different types of data sources.

### Day 3-4: Log Processing
- **Implement log processing pipeline:**
  - Develop a module to parse and process collected logs.
  - Implement basic rule engine for log analysis.

### Day 5-6: Alerting Mechanism
- **Develop alerting system:**
  - Implement an alert generation mechanism based on processed logs and analysis.
  - Create a basic notification system (e.g., email alerts).

### Day 7: Basic Security Features
- **Implement basic security features:**
  - Develop file integrity monitoring.
  - Implement basic user authentication and authorization.

## Week 3: Advanced Features, Testing, and Deployment

### Goals:
- Implement advanced features (e.g., dashboard, reporting).
- Conduct comprehensive testing.
- Prepare for deployment and finalize documentation.

### Day 1-2: Advanced Features
- **Develop dashboard and reporting:**
  - Integrate with Kibana for log visualization and dashboards.
  - Implement reporting features to generate summaries of alerts and system status.
- **Enhance security features:**
  - Add more advanced security monitoring capabilities (e.g., intrusion detection).

### Day 3-4: Comprehensive Testing
- **Conduct unit and integration testing:**
  - Write test cases for each module and run automated tests.
  - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together.
- **Fix identified bugs and issues:**
  - Address any issues found during testing.

### Day 5-6: Documentation
- **Finalize project documentation:**
  - Update README.md with detailed project description, installation, and usage instructions.
  - Create user manuals and developer guides.
- **Document code with comments and inline documentation.**

### Day 7: Deployment Preparation and Launch
- **Prepare deployment packages:**
  - Ensure all build artifacts are correctly packaged.
  - Create installation scripts and guides.
- **Deploy to a test environment:**
  - Verify deployment in a test environment and ensure it works as expected.
- **Launch the project:**
  - Deploy to production.
  - Monitor the deployment and address any post-deployment issues.
